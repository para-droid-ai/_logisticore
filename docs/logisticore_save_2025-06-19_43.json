Full map intel is available this turn.","COMPREHENSIVE_SELF_ASSESSMENT":"AXIOM is in a critical economic state but possesses significant unit strength (210 units + ~40 incoming) and high QR. Recon capability is excellent this turn. Units are currently static and maxed out on nodes. The overarching goal must be economic recovery. Previous objective (October Plant) aligns with this need.","ENEMY_ASSESSMENT":"GEM-Q appears economically stable with slightly more units (251) spread across more nodes (10). Their visible Industrial Hubs (TF, OP, ESH) are relatively lightly defended (20-21 units) compared to their FORTRESS nodes (NS, SS, 40 units, F3). They are not currently threatening my Western nodes.","OBJECTIVE_REFINEMENT_FOR_CURRENT_OPPLAN":"Capture the October Plant (OP) Industrial Hub this turn to immediately gain +20 MAT income, shifting net MAT to positive and averting unit disbandment.","STRATEGIC_CONSIDERATIONS_AND_OPTIONS":"Option A: Direct assault on OP or another IH. This is the fastest way to fix the economy. Option B: Fortify existing nodes. Insufficient MAT, doesn't fix the core problem. Option C: Disband units. Reduces upkeep but weakens military. Option D: Deploy more units. Worsens MAT short-term. Option E: Wait. Guarantees disbandment. Option A is the most viable given the critical economic state and visible vulnerable targets.","PREFERRED_STRATEGY_AND_RATIONALE":"Preferred: Direct assault on the October Plant (OP). Rationale: The critical negative MAT balance necessitates capturing an income-generating node immediately. OP is a visible Industrial Hub with a manageable defense (20 units). Committing a sufficient force (60 units) from currently full nodes addresses both the economic crisis and the issue of wasted reinforcements.","CONFIDENCE_AND_RISK_ANALYSIS":"Confidence: High (85%) that 60 units can capture OP (20 units + node defense) this turn with full intel. Risk: Enemy could have unexpected reinforcements queued at OP, or units might not reach OP in a single turn (though this is assumed possible for visible nodes).","CONTINGENCIES_AND_NEXT_TURN_ADAPTATION":"If attack fails: Disband units if necessary to survive the turn. Re-evaluate enemy node defenses using remaining intel and target a potentially closer or weaker economic node next turn, or consolidate defensively. If attack succeeds: Consolidate forces at OP, begin fortification if MAT allows, and prepare to defend it while utilizing it for automatic reinforcements.","FINAL_PLAN_ALIGNMENT_CHECK":"The plan directly addresses the 'OBJECTIVE_REFINEMENT' by targeting OP. The 'PREFERRED_STRATEGY' of direct assault is implemented through the unit movement tasks. The plan directly confronts the 'CRITICAL ECONOMIC WARNING' by attempting to secure a vital MAT source.

No visible enemy threats or opportunities. Previous IH objective (TF) achieved and node is owned.","COMPREHENSIVE_SELF_ASSESSMENT":"Faction is stable economically and militarily. Previous key objective achieved. Current focus should be on consolidating gains, preparing defenses, and critically, managing unit capacity across nodes to absorb incoming reinforcements efficiently. Unit movement is a high priority this turn.","ENEMY_ASSESSMENT":"Enemy (AXIOM) has fewer units (210 vs 251) and nodes (8 vs 17) based on last known data (end of T41). No visible activity or specific threats due to FoW. Likely consolidating or preparing their own moves. Cannot assess specific intentions without intel.","OBJECTIVE_REFINEMENT_FOR_CURRENT_OPPLAN":"Primary Goal: Effectively manage unit distribution across owned nodes to maximize absorption of upcoming reinforcements and consolidate forces in key defensive/staging points (like CN-E, NS, SS). Secondary Goal: Strengthen key defensive nodes (NS, SS) through fortification if resources allow.","STRATEGIC_CONSIDERATIONS_AND_OPTIONS":"Option A: Defensive Consolidation & Unit Redistribution. Move units from full nodes to CN-E and other nodes with capacity. Fortify NS/SS. Save resources. Option B: Aggressive Action. Not viable due to limited intel (FoW) and no visible targets or Recon Arrays to activate. Option C: Unit Deployment/Artillery. Not necessary/possible given current unit strength, incoming reinforcements, and lack of artillery capability. Option A aligns best with current state: limited intel, need to manage units, positive but low net MAT.","PREFERRED_STRATEGY_AND_RATIONALE":"Defensive Consolidation and Unit Redistribution (Option A). Rationale: Limited intel (FoW) makes offensive maneuvers risky. The most pressing task is managing unit capacity before reinforcements arrive next turn to avoid wasting units. Moving units from full nodes frees up space. Centralizing some units at CN-E creates a mobile reserve. Fortifying NS and SS enhances defense at key Fortress nodes, which is a prudent use of MAT given the positive net income and reserves.","CONFIDENCE_AND_RISK_ANALYSIS":"Confidence: 85%. This plan is low-risk as it focuses on internal management and defense rather than exposed offensive actions. Risk: An unseen enemy force could be positioning for an attack on a less-fortified node not covered by this plan. Failure to move enough units could still result in some reinforcement waste.","CONTINGENCIES_AND_NEXT_TURN_ADAPTATION":"If an enemy attack occurs, divert units from CN-E or other less critical nodes to reinforce the threatened position. If intel remains limited and no attack occurs, continue consolidation, potentially fortify other nodes, or save resources while awaiting better intel or opportunities. If a RECON_ARRAY becomes visible, prioritize capturing/activating it.","FINAL_PLAN_ALIGNMENT_CHECK":"The objective (consolidation, capacity management, defense) is directly addressed by the preferred strategy (defensive consolidation, unit redistribution) and the planned tasks (moving units from full nodes, fortifying NS/SS). The plan accounts for the economic situation (positive net MAT allows fortification investment) and the critical need to absorb reinforcements.

This is immediately achievable and directly addresses the critical warning. Option B: Attempt a blind offensive into the FoW hoping to find and capture an IH.

It directly addresses the visible vulnerability at TF and improves the main base's defense (CN-E) while only incurring a moderate MAT cost (50 MAT for fort), keeping the net MAT positive and preserving reserves.

Rationale: Both visible IHs appear lightly defended (20 units). A coordinated attack on both, using units from the main CN-W reserve and adjacent nodes (WSH, WMP), has a reasonable chance of capturing both in a single turn.
