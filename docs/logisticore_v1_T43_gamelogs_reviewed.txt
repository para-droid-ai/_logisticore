1:44:45 [T13,FORT] AXIOM: Starting FORTIFICATION phase for AXIOM.
1:44:49 [T13,FORT] AXIOM: AXIOM fortification action: HOLD_POSITION. The current economic state is critical with negative net MAT. The primary objective this turn is economic stabilization through unit disbandment (planned for the next phase). Given the critical economic state, the lack of immediate visible threats according to limited intel, and the fact that all owned nodes are currently at maximum capacity preventing effective unit repositioning via MOVE_UNITS without violating capacity rules, the most prudent action is to HOLD_POSITION. This conserves resources and avoids unnecessary movements while prioritizing the upcoming economic stabilization measures.

1:44:51 [T13,FORT] GEM-Q: Starting FORTIFICATION phase for GEM-Q.
1:45:07 [T13,FORT] GEM-Q: GEM-Q fortification action: MOVE_UNITS. OpPlan's intended moves to SS are impossible as SS is at max capacity (40/40). Adjacent nodes to CN-E are full, preventing movement out of CN-E to free space as per OpPlan. Consolidating units at the Command Node (CN-E) is a valid fortification goal. Moving 20 units from ESH (20/20) to CN-E (55/75) is possible, consolidating forces at the CN-E and freeing up ESH, aligning with general consolidation despite filling CN-E instead of freeing it.
1:45:07 [T13,FORT] GEM-Q: GEM-Q redeployed 20 units from East Supply Hub to Eastern Staging for fortification.

1:46:03 [T14,MANE] AXIOM: Starting MANEUVER phase for AXIOM.
1:46:13 [T14,MANE] AXIOM: AXIOM action: ECONOMIC_FOCUS. Critical negative Net MAT (-2.5) and low reserves (524.25) necessitate immediate economic stabilization. The OpPlan's objective is to achieve positive net MAT income by reducing unit upkeep, specifically targeting WSH for unit reduction. As a direct 'DISBAND_UNITS' action is not available in the current action list, selecting ECONOMIC_FOCUS is the most appropriate action to signal the absolute priority of economic recovery and avoid any actions that would consume further MAT or QR, aligning with the OpPlan's core goal of preventing economic collapse this turn.

1:46:28 [T14,MANE] GEM-Q: GEM-Q action: PERFORM_RECON_PULSE. The OpPlan's primary task to move units from CN-E to ESH is impossible as ESH is currently full (20/20), contradicting the OpPlan analysis. All other owned nodes are also full, preventing any unit movement from CN-E to free space for incoming reinforcements this turn. Since the core objective of freeing space cannot be achieved through movement this turn, the most strategic action is to gain full map visibility via a Recon Pulse from the active FBV array. This will provide critical intelligence to adapt the strategy for the next turn, especially after losing reinforcements due to full nodes.
1:46:28 [T14,MANE] GEM-Q: GEM-Q performed a Recon Pulse from RA-Volga. Full map intel acquired for this turn.

1:52:35 [T19,MANE] AXIOM: Starting MANEUVER phase for AXIOM.
1:52:55 [T19,MANE] AXIOM: AXIOM action: MOVE_UNITS. The faction is in a critical economic state with negative MAT income. The OpPlan prioritizes capturing an enemy Industrial Hub (TF) this turn to reverse this. Due to unit movement constraints, a direct attack on TF this turn is not possible with forces from CN-W or WG. The most effective action to enable an attack on TF next turn is to move the 20 units currently at WG to an adjacent node (NB) that is directly adjacent to the target TF. This positions the force for an immediate assault on Turn 20, aligning with the OpPlan's core objective of capturing TF as quickly as possible to address the economic crisis.

1:54:27 [T20,MANE] AXIOM: Starting MANEUVER phase for AXIOM.
1:54:47 [T20,MANE] AXIOM: AXIOM action: MOVE_UNITS. The OpPlan prioritizes capturing TF to fix the negative MAT income. My forward nodes are full, preventing consolidation onto them. A direct attack from NB (20 units vs 20 at TF) is too risky given the economic state. Moving units from NB (a forward node) to GH (a neutral node adjacent to TF) is the best way to begin consolidating forces near the target area for a more decisive attack next turn, aligning with the consolidation task while mitigating the risk of a premature, under-strength assault.
1:54:47 [T20,MANE] AXIOM: AXIOM moved 20 units from North Bridge to Gorodishche Heights.
1:54:49 [T20,MANE] GEM-Q: Starting MANEUVER phase for GEM-Q.

All currently occupied AXIOM nodes are at maximum garrison capacity, providing the strongest possible defense with current unit distribution. The only empty AXIOM node (NB) is a forward position adjacent to enemy units; reinforcing it would require drawing units from currently full nodes designated as sources for the upcoming offensive, potentially weakening the existing defensive line without securing a recent gain. Given the critical economic state and limited intel, maintaining the current defensive posture by holding position is the most prudent action to conserve forces and prepare for the next phase's planned offensive.

1:57:57 [T22,MANE] AXIOM: AXIOM action: PERFORM_RECON_PULSE. The critical negative MAT income necessitates capturing an Industrial Hub (IH) quickly, as per Operation Iron Harvest. The planned direct assault from CN-W on TF is not feasible this turn due to lack of adjacency. Attacking from forward nodes (NB, GH) is prevented by unit movement rules requiring leaving at least one unit behind, making a decisive attack with the available forward forces impossible. To effectively plan for capturing an IH next turn and address the critical economic state, I require comprehensive map intelligence. Performing a recon pulse from the active FBD array is the most strategic action this turn to gain the necessary intel on enemy positions, neutral nodes (including potential IHs), and viable attack routes, enabling a better-informed and potentially successful economic recovery operation next turn.
1:57:57 [T22,MANE] AXIOM: AXIOM performed a Recon Pulse from RA-Don. Full map intel acquired for this turn.

1:59:13 [T23,MANE] AXIOM: Starting MANEUVER phase for AXIOM.
1:59:25 [T23,MANE] AXIOM: AXIOM action: MOVE_UNITS. The critical negative MAT income requires capturing the Tractor Factory (TF) as per the OpPlan. The OpPlan's intended move of 60 units from CN-W towards TF cannot be executed in a single step or into adjacent nodes (FBD, WSH) due to node capacity limits. Moving 20 units to WMP is the maximum possible first step from CN-W towards TF via a viable path (CN-W -> WMP -> WG -> NB -> TF), initiating the movement towards the objective despite the OpPlan's flawed unit count assumption for the first step.
1:59:25 [T23,MANE] AXIOM: AXIOM moved 20 units from Western Staging to West Motor Pool.
1:59:27 [T23,MANE] GEM-Q: Starting MANEUVER phase for GEM-Q.
1:59:42 [T23,MANE] GEM-Q: GEM-Q action: MOVE_UNITS. My owned nodes, including staging nodes for the WSH assault (ESH, EMP, FBV, CN-E), are currently at maximum capacity. This prevents the direct execution of the OpPlan's staging tasks (e.g., moving units into ESH). To unblock my forces and begin maneuvering towards the OpPlan objective (WSH), I must move units out of these full nodes. Moving 20 units from ESH to the adjacent neutral node EG frees up space at ESH and positions these units on a viable path towards WSH via GH and NB, leveraging the active recon pulse intel. This action adapts the OpPlan's staging phase to the current map state constraints.
1:59:42 [T23,MANE] GEM-Q: GEM-Q moved 20 units from East Supply Hub to East Gate.

1:59:57 [T23,FORT] AXIOM: AXIOM fortification action: MOVE_UNITS. Consolidating units from the West Motor Pool (WMP) to the Western Staging Command Node (CN-W). WMP is a relatively safe node surrounded by AXIOM or empty neutral territory. Moving its 20 units to CN-W fills the Command Node to its maximum capacity (75/75), enhancing the defensive posture of the main staging area and consolidating forces in preparation for potential future actions, aligning with the Fortification phase objective.

2:01:10 [T24,MANE] AXIOM: AXIOM action: PERFORM_RECON_PULSE. The current economic state is critical (-7.5 Net MAT), requiring capture of an income node as per the OpPlan. However, the specific attack tasks in the OpPlan are currently impossible due to incorrect node adjacency assumptions (WMP to TF) and full capacity at all owned nodes preventing unit consolidation or reinforcement. To develop a viable plan to capture TF or another income source, full map intelligence is required. Performing a Recon Pulse from the active FBD array will provide this crucial information, allowing for a revised, informed action next turn to address the economic crisis effectively.
2:01:10 [T24,MANE] AXIOM: AXIOM performed a Recon Pulse from RA-Don. Full map intel acquired for this turn.

2:01:15 [T24,MANE] GEM-Q: GEM-Q action: PERFORM_RECON_PULSE. The current OpPlan's primary objective is to gain full map intelligence to overcome the Fog of War and enable informed strategic planning for future turns. Performing a Recon Pulse is the designated task to achieve this. I have an active Recon Array (FBV) and sufficient resources (MAT 749, QR 855) to cover the pulse cost (20 MAT, 40 QR). This action directly addresses the most significant current limitation (lack of intel) and aligns perfectly with the OpPlan's strategy and analysis.

2:07:53 [T29,MANE] GEM-Q: Starting MANEUVER phase for GEM-Q.
2:08:02 [T29,MANE] GEM-Q: GEM-Q action: ATTACK_NODE. Current Net MAT is critically negative (-7.5). The OpPlan's primary objective is to secure positive MAT income by capturing an Industrial Hub (WSH or TF). The OpPlan task specified moving units from OP to WSH, but OP is not connected to WSH. TF is an enemy IH adjacent to GH. Attacking TF from GH aligns with the OpPlan's core objective of capturing an IH to fix the economy. GH has 20 units, TF has 20 units. Due to the game rule requiring source units > unitsToMove for attacks/moves, I must send 19 units from GH, making it a 19v20 attack. This is the most direct feasible action to address the critical economic state and align with the OpPlan's intent to capture an enemy IH.

2:11:31 [T32,MANE] AXIOM: Starting MANEUVER phase for AXIOM.
2:12:00 [T32,MANE] AXIOM: AXIOM action: MOVE_UNITS. The critical economic state requires capturing the October Plant (OP) Industrial Hub as per the OpPlan. This requires moving a significant force from CN-W to a staging node adjacent to OP (like CS). The fastest path from CN-W to CS is 3 moves (e.g., CN-W -> WMP -> BA -> CS). All nodes adjacent to CN-W are currently full, preventing direct movement from CN-W this turn. Moving units from WMP to the empty adjacent node BA frees up capacity at WMP, enabling the first step of the CN-W -> WMP -> BA -> CS movement sequence in subsequent turns. This action is the necessary prerequisite to begin moving the main force towards the objective.

2:24:45 [T41,UPKE] GEM-Q: GEM-Q paid 102.75 MAT for upkeep (Units, Forts, 1 Recon Arrays). MAT: 421.50.
2:24:45 [T41,UPKE] AXIOM: AXIOM paid 62.50 MAT for upkeep (Units, Forts, 1 Recon Arrays). MAT: 302.50.
2:24:47 [T42,FLUC] SYSTEM: Starting FLUCTUATION phase for Turn 42.
2:25:07 [T42,FLUC] GEM-Q: OpPlan for GEM-Q: Consolidate forces, manage unit capacity for incoming reinforcements, and strengthen key defensive positions.
2:25:29 [T42,FLUC] AXIOM: OpPlan for AXIOM: Capture an enemy Industrial Hub to secure positive MAT income.
2:25:29 [T42,RESO] SYSTEM: Starting RESOURCE phase for Turn 42.
2:25:29 [T42,RESO] GEM-Q: GEM-Q gained 90 QR (from 9 connected nodes in largest network) and 110 MAT.
2:25:29 [T42,RESO] AXIOM: AXIOM gained 80 QR (from 8 connected nodes in largest network) and 60 MAT.
2:25:29 [T42,RESO] GEM-Q: GEM-Q automatically reinforced with 40 units across Command Nodes.
2:25:29 [T42,RESO] GEM-Q: GEM-Q lost 10 reinforcement units due to no available capacity.
2:25:29 [T42,RESO] AXIOM: AXIOM lost 40 reinforcement units due to no available capacity.
2:25:31 [T42,MANE] AXIOM: Starting MANEUVER phase for AXIOM.
2:25:37 [T42,MANE] AXIOM: AXIOM action: ATTACK_NODE. Critical economic state requires capturing an Industrial Hub. Executing the first task of Operation Economic Lifeline to attack the October Plant (OP) from CN-W is the most direct action to secure positive MAT income and address the crisis this turn, aligning with the OpPlan and having no immediate MAT cost.
2:25:37 [T42,MANE] AXIOM: AXIOM staged 20 units from Western Staging to attack October Plant.
2:25:39 [T42,MANE] GEM-Q: Starting MANEUVER phase for GEM-Q.
2:26:04 [T42,MANE] GEM-Q: GEM-Q action: ATTACK_NODE. Prioritizing the OpPlan objective to manage unit capacity and consolidate forces. Node NS is a full Fortress node. Moving 20 units from NS to attack/capture the adjacent neutral node KA frees up 20 unit capacity at NS, preparing it for incoming reinforcements, and expands territory. This aligns with the plan's core goals given that moving units to the full CN-E is not possible this turn.
2:26:04 [T42,MANE] GEM-Q: GEM-Q staged 20 units from Northern Strongpoint to attack Kotluban Approach.
2:26:05 [T42,COMB] SYSTEM: Starting COMBAT phase for Turn 42.
2:26:05 [T42,COMB] SYSTEM: Combat at Kotluban Approach: GEM-Q & allies (20 units) vs Neutral Garrison (0 units).
2:26:05 [T42,COMB] GEM-Q: GEM-Q wins! Kotluban Approach captured. Losses: Att-0, Def-0. (Arty: Att-0, Def-0)
2:26:05 [T42,COMB] SYSTEM: Combat at October Plant: AXIOM & allies (20 units) vs GEM-Q (20 units).
2:26:05 [T42,COMB] GEM-Q: GEM-Q holds October Plant! Losses: Att-20, Def-7. (Arty: Att-0, Def-0)
2:26:07 [T42,FORT] AXIOM: Starting FORTIFICATION phase for AXIOM.
2:26:20 [T42,FORT] AXIOM: AXIOM fortification action: MOVE_UNITS. Consolidate units from the full, internal FBD node to the Command Node (CN-W) which has capacity. This frees up space on FBD and strengthens the CN without exposing a border node or the WSH Industrial Hub to immediate risk from adjacent enemy nodes during the Fortification phase. This supports the overall plan by surviving this phase and slightly improving unit distribution.
2:26:20 [T42,FORT] AXIOM: AXIOM redeployed 15 units from RA-Don to Western Staging for fortification.
2:26:21 [T42,FORT] GEM-Q: Starting FORTIFICATION phase for GEM-Q.
2:26:28 [T42,FORT] GEM-Q: GEM-Q fortification action: MOVE_UNITS. Moving units from the overstacked node TF to NS, which has available capacity (20/40). This action addresses the critical need to manage unit capacity across owned nodes to absorb incoming reinforcements efficiently, as highlighted in the OpPlan and strategic analysis. NS is a Fortress node, consolidating units here enhances defense.
2:26:28 [T42,FORT] GEM-Q: GEM-Q redeployed 20 units from Tractor Factory to Northern Strongpoint for fortification.
2:26:29 [T42,UPKE] SYSTEM: Starting UPKEEP phase for Turn 42.
2:26:29 [T42,UPKE] GEM-Q: GEM-Q paid 111.00 MAT for upkeep (Units, Forts, 1 Recon Arrays). MAT: 420.50.
2:26:29 [T42,UPKE] AXIOM: AXIOM paid 57.50 MAT for upkeep (Units, Forts, 1 Recon Arrays). MAT: 305.00.
2:26:31 [T43,FLUC] SYSTEM: Starting FLUCTUATION phase for Turn 43.
2:26:48 [T43,FLUC] GEM-Q: OpPlan for GEM-Q: Capture the West Supply Hub (WSH) to improve economic standing and disrupt enemy MAT income.
2:27:06 [T43,FLUC] SYSTEM: Game state saved.
2:27:08 [T43,FLUC] AXIOM: OpPlan for AXIOM: Capture the Tractor Factory (TF) node to secure its 20 MAT income and improve economic stability.
