to Turn 11. Several owned nodes (WSH, FBD, BA, KA) are at maximum unit capacity, which will cause loss of efficiency for automatic reinforcements. Net MAT income is positive but low. Three adjacent neutral nodes (WG, NB, SB) are undefended and offer easy territorial gain and income increase. Neutral Fortresses (NS, SS) nearby are defended and fortified.","COMPREHENSIVE_SELF_ASSESSMENT":"AXIOM has significant MAT and QR reserves, providing strategic flexibility. We control a key Command Node (CN-W) and several resource-generating nodes. Total unit count is high (150). However, unit distribution is poor, leading to congestion. Net MAT income needs boosting for sustainability under Attrition Doctrine. Current intel is insufficient under FoW.","ENEMY_ASSESSMENT":"GEM-Q's last known state (Turn 11) showed similar resource levels, slightly fewer total units, and fewer controlled nodes (5 vs 6). Their current position, unit distribution, and strategic intent are unknown due to Fog of War. They are likely also expanding and consolidating. The lack of recent intel necessitates a Recon Pulse.","OBJECTIVE_REFINEMENT_FOR_CURRENT_OPPLAN":"The original objective to capture adjacent neutrals included BA, which is already owned. This refined objective focuses on the remaining undefended adjacent neutrals (WG, NB, SB) to achieve territorial expansion and boost income. Crucially, the plan incorporates significant unit movements to clear congested nodes, ensuring the full benefit of automatic reinforcements is gained. Adding a Recon Pulse addresses the critical intel gap under FoW.","STRATEGIC_CONSIDERATIONS_AND_OPTIONS":"1) Defensive Consolidation: Hold current ground, move units to CN-W, fortify. (Rejected: Doesn't address congestion, misses easy expansion/income, passive). 2) Aggressive Push: Attack neutral fortresses NS or SS or unknown enemy positions revealed by pulse. (Rejected: High risk, high resource/unit cost given current distribution and fortification levels). 3) Economic/Territorial Expansion + Recon: Capture undefended neutrals for income/territory, reorganize units to relieve congestion, gain intel. (Selected: Aligns with Attrition Doctrine, low risk expansion, solves critical capacity issue, improves economy, provides intel).","PREFERRED_STRATEGY_AND_RATIONALE":"The preferred strategy is to execute Operation Gateway Expansion. This involves using low unit counts to capture the undefended WG, NB, and SB nodes, immediately securing new territory and increasing node income. Concurrently, large groups of units will be moved from currently full or near-full nodes (WSH, FBD, BA, KA) to the newly captured nodes and other nodes with capacity (WMP, CN-W). This is critical for capacity management, ensuring that next turn's auto-reinforcements are fully absorbed, contributing to military strength rather than being wasted. The Recon Pulse is essential to gain a clear picture of the map and enemy dispositions, allowing for informed decisions in subsequent turns. This low-risk, high-reward approach directly addresses our current weaknesses (congestion, low net income, lack of intel) while advancing our core territorial and economic goals.","CONFIDENCE_AND_RISK_ANALYSIS":"Confidence: High. The core actions involve capturing undefended nodes and internal unit redistribution, posing minimal risk of combat loss this turn. The cost of the Recon Pulse is affordable and provides significant value. Risks: The primary risk is that the Recon Pulse reveals a major enemy force in a position to immediately counter-attack our newly captured or weakened original nodes. The plan attempts to mitigate this by moving units forward onto the captured nodes to establish a defense, but immediate large-scale combat would be unfavorable given units are currently dispersed via movement.","CONTINGENCIES_AND_NEXT_TURN_ADAPTATION":"If the Recon Pulse reveals an imminent, overwhelming enemy threat targeting our key nodes (CN-W, WSH) or the newly captured positions, the plan for Turn 13 will immediately shift to MILITARY_DEFENSE. Units will be consolidated on defensible nodes (prioritizing CN-W, potentially fortifying newly captured nodes if resources allow). If the threat is less severe or absent, we will proceed with consolidating units on WG, NB, and SB, evaluate newly revealed enemy positions and resources, potentially fortify the new front line, and identify the next expansion target (e.g., NS/SS if still neutral and feasible, or other revealed nodes). We must also move units off the overloaded WG node (25/20) in the next turn.","FINAL_PLAN_ALIGNMENT_CHECK":"This plan aligns well with the Attrition Doctrine by focusing on economic improvement (node capture, capacity management for reinforcements) and low-risk territorial expansion. It leverages existing unit strength and resource reserves for a strategic gain and crucial intelligence, setting up a stronger position for future turns."}},"totalUnitsLost":6,"totalUnitsDeployed":131,"battlesWon":5,"battlesLost":0,"evolvedUnits":0,"totalMATGenerated":395,"totalMATConsumed":229.75,"totalMATSpentOnUnitDeployment":0,"totalMATSpentOnUnitUpkeep":229.75,"totalUnitTurns":919,"unitsDeployedPerTurnHistory":[0,0,0],"unitsLostPerTurnHistory":[0,6,0],"currentTurnUnitsDeployed":0,"currentTurnUnitsLost":0,"totalMATSpentOnFortifications":0,"battlesWonAsAttacker":5,"battlesInitiated":5,"unitsLostInSuccessfulCaptures":6,"nodesSuccessfullyCaptured":5,"cumulativeMATDeniedToEnemyFromCaptures":35,"totalAttackerStrengthCommittedInInitiatedBattles":69,"totalDefenderStrengthFacedInInitiatedBattles":5,"battlesInitiatedCountForOverkillIndex":5,"isReconSystemActive":false,"activatedReconNodeIds":[],"hasActiveReconPulseThisTurn":false,"pulsesPerformedCount":0,"intelAdvantageTurnsCount":0,"qrSpentOnRecon":0,"matSpentOnRecon":0},"GEM-Q":{"id":"GEM-Q","name":"GEM-Q","color":"text-terminal-red","qr":400,"MAT":837.5,"nodesControlled":5,"totalUnits":129,"totalArtillery":0,"totalInfiltrators":0,"totalFortifiedNodes":1,"currentOpPlan":{"id":"op-GEM-Q-1750378886268","turnGenerated":12,"objective":"Clear unit capacity by capturing adjacent neutral nodes, securing income and expanding territory, and positioning units for the capture of the Tractor Factory (TF).","operation":"Operation Broad Front","tasks":["Move 10 units from ESH to EG (Attack EG)","Move 10 units from ESH to GH (Attack GH)","Move 10 units from OP to MK (Attack MK)","Move 10 units from EMP to CS (Attack CS)","Move 10 units from EMP to KR (Attack KR)","Move 17 units from CN-E to OP","Move 14 units from CN-E to FBV","Move 10 units from CN-E to EG","Move 10 units from CN-E to GH","Move 10 units from CN-E to CS","Move 10 units from CN-E to KR","Move 4 units from CN-E to MK"],"priority":"TERRITORIAL_EXPANSION","targetNodeIds":["CS","KR","EG","GH","MK","TF"],"scratchpadOutput":{"CRITICAL_GAME_FACTORS":"My CN-E, EMP, and ESH are at max unit capacity, meaning incoming auto-reinforcements will be wasted.

Opportunity to capture multiple adjacent neutral nodes to increase income and unit capacity.

Threats: Unknown enemy position and strength under FoW; potential enemy advance on current or target nodes.","ENEMY_ASSESSMENT":"Based on Turn 11 intel, AXIOM has slightly more total units and nodes controlled than me. Their resource reserves are comparable. Due to active Fog of War and no recent Recon Pulse, their current unit locations, economic state, and intentions are unknown. They are likely also expanding and consolidating under the Attrition Doctrine.","OBJECTIVE_REFINEMENT_FOR_CURRENT_OPPLAN":"The previous objective included securing OP (which is done) and clearing capacity/capturing neutrals. The primary immediate issue is the critical unit overflow. The refined objective focuses directly on using these excess units to capture the numerous adjacent undefended/lightly defended neutral nodes. This simultaneously clears capacity, expands territory, boosts the economy, and positions units for the subsequent capture of the Tractor Factory (TF), aligning perfectly with Attrition Doctrine goals.","STRATEGIC_CONSIDERATIONS_AND_OPTIONS":"1. Aggressive Expansion (Chosen): Use excess units to capture multiple neutral nodes, addressing capacity, expanding economy, and setting up TF capture. 2. Defensive Consolidation: Hold current nodes, fortify, risk wasting reinforcements. Not ideal with critical capacity issue and available neutral targets. 3. Recon Pulse + Limited Action: Use QR/MAT for a pulse, then act on intel. Delays addressing capacity issue and territorial expansion. 4. Direct Assault on TF: Focus all available units on TF. Only captures one node, potentially leaving capacity issues unresolved.","PREFERRED_STRATEGY_AND_RATIONALE":"The preferred strategy is aggressive expansion targeting adjacent neutral nodes. This is optimal because it directly resolves the most pressing issue (unit capacity at full nodes) by relocating units to newly captured nodes or nodes with space. It significantly improves my economic standing by capturing multiple resource-generating nodes. It positions units strategically for the high-priority capture of the Tractor Factory (TF) in the next turn. Attacking undefended or lightly defended neutral nodes minimizes risk given the active Fog of War. The current strong economy supports the required unit movements. This widespread action also makes it harder for the enemy to predict my main axis of advance (which is towards TF via EG/GH/MK).","CONFIDENCE_AND_RISK_ANALYSIS":"Confidence: High. The plan relies on capturing neutral nodes with sufficient force, which is low-risk. It addresses the primary critical issue (capacity). Risks: Unit survival/arrival mechanics on multi-stack attacks/reinforcements could lead to overstacking if miscalculated (mitigated by distributing units across many targets). Unexpected enemy presence on targeted neutral nodes (low probability for undefended/lightly defended).","CONTINGENCIES_AND_NEXT_TURN_ADAPTATION":"If any neutral capture fails, the units involved are lost, potentially exacerbating the capacity problem. The immediate fallback would be to move any remaining excess units from full nodes to nodes with space (FBV, OP if not filled, or newly captured nodes with remaining space like MK). Prioritize activating Recon Array FBV next turn to gain intel before attempting further large-scale movements or attacks, especially the TF assault.

Active Fog of War means enemy location and strength are unknown. Multiple adjacent neutral nodes are visible with zero or minimal neutral units, including a high-value Industrial Hub (OP).","COMPREHENSIVE_SELF_ASSESSMENT":"GEM-Q is in a strong economic position with substantial reserves and positive income. Total unit count is healthy, but distribution is poor due to full nodes. The primary weakness is the self-imposed capacity limitation preventing efficient use of auto-reinforcements. Opportunities lie in capturing adjacent, weakly defended neutral nodes to immediately expand territory, increase income, and solve the capacity problem. Threats include the unknown location and potential sudden contact with the AXIOM enemy.","ENEMY_ASSESSMENT":"Based on Turn 10 intel, AXIOM has slightly more total units and controls more nodes than GEM-Q, with comparable resource levels. Their current activity and location are unknown due to Fog of War. They are likely also expanding into neutral territory from their staging area(s), potentially leading to a clash on newly captured nodes.","OBJECTIVE_REFINEMENT_FOR_CURRENT_OPPLAN":"The standing objective 'Secure adjacent neutral nodes to expand territory, improve economy, and manage unit capacity' is highly relevant. This plan refines it by explicitly targeting specific low-resistance adjacent nodes (EG, KR, CS, GH) and the high-value OP Industrial Hub using units from full/near-full nodes to achieve both expansion and critical capacity management simultaneously. Deploying new units reinforces the core staging area for future actions.","STRATEGIC_CONSIDERATIONS_AND_OPTIONS":"1. **Defensive Consolidation:** Hold current ground, fortify, deploy units to CN-E. (Rejected: Does not address capacity issue, yields neutral territory advantage, no economic improvement). 2. **Focused IH Capture:** Commit all available force to capture OP. (Rejected: Overkill for 5 neutral units, neglects easy adjacent captures, doesn't fully solve capacity on other nodes). 3. **Broad Sweep (Chosen):** Use units from multiple full nodes to capture several adjacent neutral nodes (including OP), addressing capacity, economy, and territory simultaneously. This balances risk and reward given the visible state of adjacent nodes.","PREFERRED_STRATEGY_AND_RATIONALE":"The preferred strategy is 'Operation Autumn Sweep', involving simultaneous attacks on five adjacent neutral nodes. This is optimal because it directly uses excess units from our currently full nodes (ESH, EMP, FBV, CN-E) to initiate captures, solving the capacity issue and ensuring effective landing of incoming auto-reinforcements. Capturing OP provides a significant economic boost (20 MAT/turn), while capturing the other standard nodes increases both MAT/QR income and the base for next turn's auto-reinforcements. The low number of neutral units on these nodes makes capture highly probable and resource-efficient.","CONFIDENCE_AND_RISK_ANALYSIS":"Confidence: High. The plan targets known weak points, addresses a critical internal issue (capacity), and is well within current resource limits. Risks: The primary risk is encountering a significant, unforeseen enemy presence on the border of or within the newly captured territory due to the active Fog of War. This could lead to losing some captured nodes or requiring rapid reinforcement.","CONTINGENCIES_AND_NEXT_TURN_ADAPTATION":"If any primary target (especially OP) is successfully captured but immediately contested by the enemy, the fallback is to consolidate forces on the perimeter of the captured territory, reinforce from CN-E (which will receive deployed and auto-reinforced units), and hold the line. If the OP capture specifically fails, but other nodes are taken, prioritize securing the captured standards (EG, KR, CS, GH), reinforcing them, and potentially activating the FBV Recon Array next turn if intelligence is critical and QR/MAT allows, to understand the enemy's position before attempting another push.","FINAL_PLAN_ALIGNMENT_CHECK":"The plan aligns perfectly with the current OpPlan objective of securing adjacent neutrals for expansion, economy, and capacity management. It utilizes current unit distribution challenges as an impetus for expansion and is fully supported by current resource levels. The priority is correctly set to Territorial Expansion."}},{"id":"op-GEM-Q-1750378655842","turnGenerated":10,"objective":"Secure adjacent neutral nodes to expand territory, improve economy, and manage unit capacity.","operation":"Operation Clearing the Path","tasks":["MOVE 1 UNIT FROM ESH TO EG","MOVE 1 UNIT FROM EMP TO KR","MOVE 1 UNIT FROM EMP TO CS","MOVE 1 UNIT FROM CN-E TO FBV","MOVE 19 UNITS FROM ESH TO EG","MOVE 18 UNITS FROM EMP TO KR","MOVE 30 UNITS FROM CN-E TO CS","MOVE 15 UNITS FROM CN-E TO FBV"],"priority":"TERRITORIAL_EXPANSION","targetNodeIds":["FBV","EG","KR","CS"],"scratchpadOutput":{"CRITICAL_GAME_FACTORS":"Owned nodes (CN-E, ESH, EMP) are at maximum unit capacity, leading to wasted auto-reinforcements (approx. 15 units this turn).

Enemy intel from Turn 9 shows approximate parity but control of one more node. Attrition Doctrine requires focusing on economic strength and gradual superiority.","COMPREHENSIVE_SELF_ASSESSMENT":"Strengths: Significant MAT (818.5) and QR (330) reserves, strong concentration of units on owned nodes, control of Eastern CN and IH, capture of Recon Array (FBV) is imminent and affordable. Weaknesses: Critically low Net MAT, all owned nodes are full preventing efficient auto-reinforcement, limited visibility beyond adjacent nodes. Opportunities: Multiple adjacent neutral nodes offer low-cost capture, income increase, and critical space for reinforcements. Threats: Enemy likely expanding on their flank, potential counter-attack on newly captured, unfortified nodes.","ENEMY_ASSESSMENT":"AXIOM intel from Turn 9 indicates similar resource levels and total units (115 vs 115). They control 4 nodes compared to my 3. No active Recon System or visible artillery/infiltrators reported. They are likely consolidating or expanding on their side of the map. Given the intel is a turn old and FoW is active, their exact current positions and intentions are unknown, but a major, immediate threat to my core CN/IH seems unlikely based on last turn's data.","OBJECTIVE_REFINEMENT_FOR_CURRENT_OPPLAN":"The primary objective of securing adjacent neutral nodes directly addresses the most critical immediate issue: the full unit capacity on owned nodes. This plan utilizes the 'wasted' units to capture territory, significantly increasing income (improving Net MAT) and creating necessary space for future auto-reinforcements. This simultaneously achieves economic improvement, territorial expansion, and effective military deployment, aligning perfectly with the Attrition Doctrine and the need for capacity management.","STRATEGIC_CONSIDERATIONS_AND_OPTIONS":"1. Defensive Consolidation: Focus solely on fortifying CN-E. This is poor due to full nodes wasting reinforcements and low Net MAT.\n2. Recon Pulse: Use MAT/QR for a pulse. Provides intel but doesn't solve capacity or economic issues this turn, and is expensive.\n3. Economic Expansion via Neutral Capture (Chosen): Use existing units to capture adjacent neutral nodes, boosting income and freeing up capacity. This is the most advantageous option given the game state.","PREFERRED_STRATEGY_AND_RATIONALE":"The preferred strategy is aggressive, low-risk territorial expansion onto adjacent neutral nodes. My owned nodes are critically full (CN-E 75/75, ESH 20/20, EMP 20/20), meaning incoming auto-reinforcements (15 units) will be lost unless space is created. By moving large portions of these static units to capture undefended/weakly defended adjacent nodes (FBV, EG, KR, CS), I solve the capacity problem, convert surplus units into strategic assets, gain significant MAT/QR income (4 new nodes * +5 MAT/QR each = +20 MAT, +20 QR), and expand my territory. The chosen nodes are directly connected and easy targets. This plan dramatically improves my Net MAT, increases my total unit capacity for future turns, and secures the FBV Recon Array for future intelligence gathering. The unit movements are structured to empty the full nodes effectively.","CONFIDENCE_AND_RISK_ANALYSIS":"Confidence: High. The plan targets undefended or lightly defended nodes using overwhelming local force derived from existing full stacks. The immediate gains (resource increase, capacity relief) are substantial and certain. Risks: The primary risk is that the enemy might also be targeting these specific nodes, leading to unexpected contact and potential combat on unfortified positions. However, based on available intel, this is assessed as low probability for large enemy forces. Newly captured nodes will be vulnerable to counter-attack in subsequent turns.","CONTINGENCIES_AND_NEXT_TURN_ADAPTATION":"If any capture attempt fails (highly unlikely with planned forces vs target defense), forces will consolidate on successfully captured nodes and reinforce core positions from CN-E. The next turn objective would shift to reinforcing and fortifying successful captures and potentially launching a Recon Pulse if intel remains poor. If all captures succeed, the next turn will focus on redistributing units across the new larger territory, fortifying key captured nodes (especially EG, KR, CS for defense and income), activating FBV if beneficial, and re-evaluating expansion or defensive postures based on new intel or enemy movements.","FINAL_PLAN_ALIGNMENT_CHECK":"This plan strongly aligns with the Attrition Doctrine by prioritizing economic growth and territorial control. It directly addresses the critical current issue of full unit capacity and low Net MAT, setting the faction up for greater stability and strength in future turns.

They control 2 nodes, likely including their CN. Their strategy and unit disposition are currently unknown due to active FoW and their inactive recon. They have not used a pulse either. Their most likely initial expansion path would be from their CN, wherever it is (likely CN-W).","OBJECTIVE_REFINEMENT_FOR_CURRENT_OPPLAN":"The previous objective to 'Capture key neutral nodes, secure Recon Array Volga, and activate intel network' remains highly relevant. Capturing FBV addresses the 'secure Recon Array Volga' and 'activate intel network' parts (activation comes after capture). Capturing EG and KR addresses 'capture key neutral nodes' and expands the eastern front, increasing resource income and creating forward staging areas. The plan leverages the strong economy and unit capacity to achieve these goals simultaneously.","STRATEGIC_CONSIDERATIONS_AND_OPTIONS":"1. Defensive Consolidation: Focus solely on fortifying current nodes and deploying units defensively. (Rejected - Strong economy and central map neutrals invite expansion; FoW makes static defense risky). 2. Full Economic Focus: Deploy units, fortify, but minimal movement/capture beyond cheapest nodes. (Rejected - Misses opportunity to secure high-value RA-Volga and necessary territory under favourable conditions). 3. Aggressive Expansion/Recon: Use pulse, target key neutrals including RA-Volga, deploy units, begin fortification. (Chosen - Best leverages current resources and intel gap, aligns with achieving key objective FBV).","PREFERRED_STRATEGY_AND_RATIONALE":"The preferred strategy is aggressive territorial expansion combined with crucial intelligence gathering. Using the RECON_PULSE is paramount to gain immediate visibility under FoW and confirm target viability and enemy positions. Simultaneous capture attempts on FBV (RA-Volga), EG, and KR leverage existing unit distribution and secure vital nodes for resources and long-term intel. Fortifying ESH (Industrial Hub) protects a key economic asset. Deploying units at CN-E builds combat reserves and utilizes available MAT income while maintaining capacity space for auto-reinforcements. This approach aligns with the Attrition doctrine by securing resources and positioning for future control, while the Recon Pulse provides the necessary information advantage.","CONFIDENCE_AND_RISK_ANALYSIS":"Confidence: High. The plan utilizes a strong economic position and available units to target key objectives. The Recon Pulse significantly reduces the primary risk of enemy unknowns. Risks: The main risk is enemy presence on or near the target nodes that wasn't accounted for by the pulse (e.g., enemy units moving during the turn), potentially leading to failed captures or costly engagements. Capturing FBV requires defeating 3 neutral units, a low but present risk of failure if too few units are sent or if enemy intervenes.","CONTINGENCIES_AND_NEXT_TURN_ADAPTATION":"If the Recon Pulse reveals significant enemy forces near the target nodes, movements will be adjusted based on priority: secure EG and KR first if they are clear, as they provide resources and connections. If FBV capture fails (due to enemy or neutral units), the plan for the next turn will shift to reinforcing an assault on FBV or consolidating gains from EG/KR and scouting other potential expansion routes revealed by the pulse. If any owned node is threatened, units will be redirected defensively from CN-E.","FINAL_PLAN_ALIGNMENT_CHECK":"The plan directly pursues the objective of securing RA-Volga and expanding territory, aligns with the Attrition doctrine by prioritizing resource-generating nodes (EG, KR) and protecting an Industrial Hub (ESH), leverages a strong economy, and addresses the crucial intel gap with a Recon Pulse.

Rationale: My economy is strong, allowing immediate investment in expansion and intel. Capturing multiple undefended nodes provides quick returns in MAT/QR income and auto-reinforcements. Securing FBV and activating the Recon Array addresses the critical FoW limitation, providing intelligence needed for future strategic decisions.

This plan utilizes units from ESH to create needed capacity, and units from CN-E to capture other nodes. While core garrisons are temporarily reduced, the economic gains allow for faster unit deployment, and reinforcements will arrive next turn. Unknown enemy position makes general expansion and intel safer than a focused aggressive move.","CONFIDENCE_AND_RISK_ANALYSIS":"Confidence: Medium-High. Capturing neutral nodes is low risk. Main risk is leaving core nodes (CN-E) with low garrisons (7 units) if the enemy makes an unexpected, aggressive push. However, current intel doesn't indicate this is imminent, and the economic/intel benefits are substantial.","CONTINGENCIES_AND_NEXT_TURN_ADAPTATION":"If a capture fails (unlikely), units will fall back. Next turn's priority would be to assess enemy presence, consolidate forces, and potentially re-attempt capture if feasible, or focus on another uncontested neutral node to maintain economic growth. If FBV capture fails, re-evaluating the intel situation and potentially using a costly Recon Pulse might be necessary depending on other intel gathered.","FINAL_PLAN_ALIGNMENT_CHECK":"The plan aligns with the Attrition Doctrine (economic focus), the current OpPlan (expansion/intel), and utilizes resources effectively by moving units from a full node (ESH) and leveraging healthy MAT/QR reserves for Recon Array activation.

Capturing these nodes will increase income by 15 MAT and 15 QR per turn, further improving economic stability under the Attrition Doctrine. Moving units from WMP, FBD, and KA frees up capacity on those nodes. The move from WSH to CN-W consolidates units and creates space at WSH. Deploying 10 units utilizes available MAT and adds to the unit pool, ensuring maximum use of newly available capacity across the expanded network.","CONFIDENCE_AND_RISK_ANALYSIS":"Confidence: High.

My preferred strategy is to immediately capture several adjacent neutral nodes with few or no units (BA, WG, NB, FBD). This is a low-cost, low-risk operation that requires only unit movement. By moving units from the full/near-full nodes into the newly captured ones, I create significant capacity for incoming reinforcements. Specifically, moving 20 units from WMP to BA, 20 from WSH to WG, 19 from KA to NB, and 10 from CN-W to FBD will clear WMP, WSH, and KA, and slightly reduce CN-W congestion. This positions my units on new front lines, increases my node count from 4 to 8 (doubling future auto-reinforcements to 40/turn), and aligns perfectly with the Attrition Doctrine by building gradual superiority through territory and unit mass. Capacity management is the explicit driver here; the plan prioritizes using excess units to seize valuable territory that also serves as staging/reinforcement absorption points. Fortification and advanced military actions are secondary to resolving the fundamental capacity problem this turn.","CONFIDENCE_AND_RISK_ANALYSIS":"Confidence: High. The targets (BA, WG, NB, FBD) present minimal resistance (0-5 units). Capturing all four using planned movements is highly probable. Risk: Low. The primary risk is that the enemy is positioned adjacent to one of the targeted nodes and intercepts the movement, but this is unknown under FoW. My core node CN-W remains relatively well-defended. The newly captured nodes might be vulnerable initially, but the gain in capacity and territory outweighs this risk at this stage.","CONTINGENCIES_AND_NEXT_TURN_ADAPTATION":"If all captures succeed, the plan for Turn 11 will involve consolidating the new front lines (BA, WG, NB, FBD), distributing the significantly increased incoming reinforcements (now 40 units) efficiently across all 8 controlled nodes, and assessing the next best expansion targets (e.g., towards NS via NB, into unknown territory via WG/BA/NB, or activating FBD for intel if QR/MAT allows). If any capture fails (most likely FBD), the units will remain adjacent. I would re-evaluate the failed node target based on enemy presence and prioritize consolidating the nodes that were successfully captured.","FINAL_PLAN_ALIGNMENT_CHECK":"This plan aligns with AXIOM's overall goals by increasing territory, securing key junctions (WG, NB, BA), increasing income potential (longer term as node income improves Net MAT), and critically, resolving the unit congestion issue which is currently hindering reinforcement effectiveness.

Territorial Expansion (Chosen): Capture BA/KA. Solves capacity, expands territory, uses zero combat MAT, low risk. This aligns best with both Attrition Doctrine (gradual superiority, resource control via more nodes) and the immediate capacity crisis.","PREFERRED_STRATEGY_AND_RATIONALE":"The preferred strategy is capturing the neutral, empty nodes KA and BA. This is chosen because WSH and WMP are at full capacity, and CN-W is nearing capacity. Failing to move units out will result in wasted automatic reinforcements (15 units this turn). Capturing KA and BA requires no combat MAT cost as they have 0 neutral units. By moving the maximum units from WSH (20) to KA and WMP (20) to BA, I completely clear these nodes, allowing them to receive future reinforcements efficiently. This expands my controlled territory by two nodes, increasing future auto-reinforcements and net income, and positions units on new fronts (towards WG, SB, SS, NS, NB) for future assessment or operations. This low-risk, high-reward move directly addresses the most pressing issue (capacity) while contributing to long-term economic and territorial goals in line with the Attrition Doctrine.","CONFIDENCE_AND_RISK_ANALYSIS":"Confidence: High. Capturing neutral nodes with 0 units is guaranteed to succeed. The primary goal of freeing up capacity on WSH and WMP will be achieved. Risks: Minimal combat risk. The main risk is that moving units into KA and BA might immediately reveal nearby enemy forces on connected nodes (WG, SB, SS, NS, NB) that were previously unseen. However, this revelation is also valuable intel, and the units moved provide a presence to react. The units moved are expendable from the perspective of clearing over-capacity nodes.","CONTINGENCIES_AND_NEXT_TURN_ADAPTATION":"This plan has no failure condition for the captures themselves (0 enemy units). If the capture of BA or KA immediately brings me into contact with a large enemy force on an adjacent node (e.g., WG, SB, SS, NS, NB), the contingency for the next turn will be immediate defensive consolidation on the newly captured node(s) and its/their adjacent friendly node(s), while re-evaluating the enemy's strength and likely vector using newly gained visibility. If no significant enemy presence is revealed, the plan for the next turn would be to consolidate units in the new nodes and CN-W, reassess the map based on new visibility, and potentially plan for further cautious expansion or activation of FBD if intel is still poor.","FINAL_PLAN_ALIGNMENT_CHECK":"The plan aligns well with the Attrition Doctrine by securing additional territory and nodes, increasing economic potential (future auto-reinforcements distributed over more nodes), and addressing a critical capacity limitation.

My current economic state is strong with significant reserves and positive net income. Unit concentration in the west provides a localized advantage. There are adjacent neutral nodes with low/zero unit presence representing low-risk expansion opportunities. WSH node capacity is at 50%, needing consideration for automatic reinforcements.","COMPREHENSIVE_SELF_ASSESSMENT":"AXIOM possesses a healthy reserve of MAT and QR, enabling unit deployment and expansion. Net MAT income is positive, supporting the Attrition doctrine. Unit strength is concentrated in the west. AXIOM lacks advanced capabilities like artillery or active recon, relying on standard visibility. The opportunity exists to expand into adjacent neutral territory to increase income and staging points. A primary weakness is limited intelligence on enemy disposition elsewhere.","ENEMY_ASSESSMENT":"Based on Turn 1 intel, GEM-Q has comparable resources and total units. They control 2 nodes, suggesting one is likely CN-E and another adjacent. Their main force is likely concentrated in the east. They also did not have active recon in Turn 1. Due to FoW, their current unit distribution and intentions are unknown, posing a potential threat if they are also expanding aggressively or targeting key neutral nodes I might want.","OBJECTIVE_REFINEMENT_FOR_CURRENT_OPPLAN":"The standing objective 'Secure Western Economic Assets' remains highly relevant and achievable. Capturing WMP directly supports this by adding a MAT/QR producing node. It also expands my territorial control, providing strategic depth and a forward position. This action leverages current strengths (economic reserves, unit positioning) and addresses the need to create space for incoming reinforcements by adding a new controlled node destination.","STRATEGIC_CONSIDERATIONS_AND_OPTIONS":"1. Capture WMP (Chosen): Low risk, secures income, expands territory, prepares for future moves. 2. Capture FBD: Gains Recon Array capability, moderate risk (5 units), no income gain this turn. 3. Capture KA: Secures income node, low risk (0 units), but connects to potentially higher-risk unseen nodes. 4. Recon Pulse: Gain full intel, but consumes QR/MAT and delays territorial/economic gain this turn.","PREFERRED_STRATEGY_AND_RATIONALE":"The preferred strategy is to capture the WMP node. This is a neutral node with 0 defending units, making it a guaranteed low-cost capture. It provides valuable MAT and QR income, reinforcing my economic base in line with the Attrition doctrine. The capture expands my controlled territory in the west, aligning with the 'Secure Western Economic Assets' objective. Deploying 10 units ensures my core CN-W remains well-defended while simultaneously adding to my total force pool and providing units that can be moved next turn. Moving 10 units to WMP secures the node strongly and provides a staging force for potential follow-up moves towards FBD or BA. This also creates capacity for anticipated automatic reinforcements (5 units per controlled node) by adding WMP as a potential destination next turn, preventing waste if WSH gets full.","CONFIDENCE_AND_RISK_ANALYSIS":"Confidence: High. The core task (capturing WMP) involves assaulting a neutral node with 0 units, which is a guaranteed success. Risks: The primary risk is that the enemy is making significant moves elsewhere on the map unseen due to FoW. My focus is entirely western this turn, leaving other areas unmonitored. However, this is a calculated risk necessary for early expansion.","CONTINGENCIES_AND_NEXT_TURN_ADAPTATION":"If, against all expectations, the capture of WMP fails (e.g., enemy moves there first, though unlikely with 0 neutral units), I would consolidate all forces at CN-W and WSH, deploy more units defensively, and prioritize a Recon Pulse next turn to understand the sudden appearance of enemy forces. If WMP is successfully captured (the expected outcome), Turn 3 will involve assessing unit distribution between CN-W, WSH, and WMP, potentially moving units to balance forces or prepare for further expansion towards FBD, BA, or KA depending on the state of those nodes and any new intel. Activating FBD would be a strong consideration if captured.","FINAL_PLAN_ALIGNMENT_CHECK":"The plan aligns with the current OpPlan objective ('Secure Western Economic Assets') and priority ('TERRITORIAL_EXPANSION'). It leverages existing resources effectively and considers unit capacity management for incoming reinforcements. It fits the Attrition Doctrine by prioritizing resource gain and territorial control."}}],"NEUTRAL":[]},"lastTurnNodeActivity":[],"gameStats":{"mostBrutalBattle":{"id":"battle-1750378712039-FBD","timestamp":"8:18:32 PM","turn":10,"attacker":"AXIOM","defender":"NEUTRAL","nodeId":"FBD","nodeName":"RA-Don","outcome":"ATTACKER_WINS","attackerUnitsBefore":10,"defenderUnitsBefore":5,"attackerLosses":6,"defenderLosses":5,"nodeCaptured":true,"fortificationBonusUsed":0,"fortificationHPDamage":0,"rounds":[{"roundNumber":1,"attackerUnitsStart":10,"defenderUnitsStart":5,"attackerDiceRolls":[5,4],"defenderDiceRolls":[6],"defenderBonusesApplied":[],"attackerFinalRolls":[5,4],"defenderFinalRolls":[6],"attackerLossesThisRound":1,"defenderLossesThisRound":0,"attackerUnitsEnd":9,"defenderUnitsEnd":5},{"roundNumber":2,"attackerUnitsStart":9,"defenderUnitsStart":5,"attackerDiceRolls":[5],"defenderDiceRolls":[3],"defenderBonusesApplied":[],"attackerFinalRolls":[5],"defenderFinalRolls":[3],"attackerLossesThisRound":0,"defenderLossesThisRound":1,"attackerUnitsEnd":9,"defenderUnitsEnd":4},{"roundNumber":3,"attackerUnitsStart":9,"defenderUnitsStart":4,"attackerDiceRolls":[3],"defenderDiceRolls":[1],"defenderBonusesApplied":[],"attackerFinalRolls":[3],"defenderFinalRolls":[1],"attackerLossesThisRound":0,"defenderLossesThisRound":1,"attackerUnitsEnd":9,"defenderUnitsEnd":3},{"roundNumber":4,"attackerUnitsStart":9,"defenderUnitsStart":3,"attackerDiceRolls":[1],"defenderDiceRolls":[6],"defenderBonusesApplied":[],"attackerFinalRolls":[1],"defenderFinalRolls":[6],"attackerLossesThisRound":1,"defenderLossesThisRound":0,"attackerUnitsEnd":8,"defenderUnitsEnd":3},{"roundNumber":5,"attackerUnitsStart":8,"defenderUnitsStart":3,"attackerDiceRolls":[5],"defenderDiceRolls":[3],"defenderBonusesApplied":[],"attackerFinalRolls":[5],"defenderFinalRolls":[3],"attackerLossesThisRound":0,"defenderLossesThisRound":1,"attackerUnitsEnd":8,"defenderUnitsEnd":2},{"roundNumber":6,"attackerUnitsStart":8,"defenderUnitsStart":2,"attackerDiceRolls":[1],"defenderDiceRolls":[4],"defenderBonusesApplied":[],"attackerFinalRolls":[1],"defenderFinalRolls":[4],"attackerLossesThisRound":1,"defenderLossesThisRound":0,"attackerUnitsEnd":7,"defenderUnitsEnd":2},{"roundNumber":7,"attackerUnitsStart":7,"defenderUnitsStart":2,"attackerDiceRolls":[2],"defenderDiceRolls":[3],"defenderBonusesApplied":[],"attackerFinalRolls":[2],"defenderFinalRolls":[3],"attackerLossesThisRound":1,"defenderLossesThisRound":0,"attackerUnitsEnd":6,"defenderUnitsEnd":2},{"roundNumber":8,"attackerUnitsStart":6,"defenderUnitsStart":2,"attackerDiceRolls":[3],"defenderDiceRolls":[4],"defenderBonusesApplied":[],"attackerFinalRolls":[3],"defenderFinalRolls":[4],"attackerLossesThisRound":1,"defenderLossesThisRound":0,"attackerUnitsEnd":5,"defenderUnitsEnd":2},{"roundNumber":9,"attackerUnitsStart":5,"defenderUnitsStart":2,"attackerDiceRolls":[6],"defenderDiceRolls":[6],"defenderBonusesApplied":[],"attackerFinalRolls":[6],"defenderFinalRolls":[6],"attackerLossesThisRound":1,"defenderLossesThisRound":0,"attackerUnitsEnd":4,"defenderUnitsEnd":2},{"roundNumber":10,"attackerUnitsStart":4,"defenderUnitsStart":2,"attackerDiceRolls":[2],"defenderDiceRolls":[1],"defenderBonusesApplied":[],"attackerFinalRolls":[2],"defenderFinalRolls":[1],"attackerLossesThisRound":0,"defenderLossesThisRound":1,"attackerUnitsEnd":4,"defenderUnitsEnd":1},{"roundNumber":11,"attackerUnitsStart":4,"defenderUnitsStart":1,"attackerDiceRolls":[6],"defenderDiceRolls":[1],"defenderBonusesApplied":[],"attackerFinalRolls":[6],"defenderFinalRolls":[1],"attackerLossesThisRound":0,"defenderLossesThisRound":1,"attackerUnitsEnd":4,"defenderUnitsEnd":0}],"attackerArtilleryFired":0,"defenderArtilleryFired":0,"attackerLossesFromDefensiveArtillery":0,"defenderLossesFromOffensiveArtillery":0}},"isFogOfWarActive":true,"factionIntelSnapshots":{"GEM-Q":{"turnSnapshotTaken":11,"qr":400,"MAT":837.5,"nodesControlled":5,"totalUnits":129,"totalArtillery":0,"totalUnitsLost":19,"totalUnitsDeployed":123,"totalMATGenerated":405,"totalMATConsumed":217.5,"isUnderLowSupply":false,"isReconSystemActive":false},"AXIOM":{"turnSnapshotTaken":11,"qr":380,"MAT":815.25,"nodesControlled":6,"totalUnits":150,"totalArtillery":0,"totalUnitsLost":6,"totalUnitsDeployed":131,"totalMATGenerated":395,"totalMATConsumed":229.75,"isUnderLowSupply":false,"isReconSystemActive":false}}}
